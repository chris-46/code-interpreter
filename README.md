Action: CSV Agent
Action Input: {"question": "which season has the most episodes?"}

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: To find out which season has the most episodes, I need to count the number of episodes in each season. I can do this by grouping the dataframe by the 'Season' column and then counting the number of rows in each group.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby('Season').size().idxmax()4The season with the most episodes is season 4.
Final Answer: 4
